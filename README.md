Google Apps Script to email myself a summary of the last day's credit card transaction alerts from Chase

# Summary
I wanted to be able to keep an eye on my credit card transactions in close to real time, but I found that push notifications and immediate email alerts were distracting and caused clutter. In my Chase account, I set up an alert to send me an email of any charge over $0.01. A Gmail filter automatically archives the individual alerts, and the script is scheduled to run daily. It checks my inbox, and emails me a summary of any new transaction alerts.
